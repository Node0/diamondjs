## 🛠️ Current Status

**🚧 In Active Development 🚧**

DiamondJS is currently in the design and early implementation phase. The architecture specification v1.2 is complete, incorporating:

- ✅ Hybrid reactivity system design
- ✅ Collection class for high-performance large datasets
- ✅ Pure class-based architecture to prevent LLM steering issues
- ✅ Comprehensive performance analysis
- ✅ Complete LOC budgets validated against Aurelia 2.0 archaeology


**Key Milestones**:
- **Phase 0-1** (Weeks 1-4): Core binding system and POC
- **Phase 2-3** (Weeks 5-8): Component system and template controllers
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 9-10): Hybrid reactivity system implementation
- **Phase 5-6** (Weeks 11-14): Advanced features and DX polish
- **Target**: v0.1.0 proof-of-concept with LLM debugging validation
